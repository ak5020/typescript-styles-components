# Typescript

We define the ThemeFuncProps interface to specify the types for the props passed to the ThemeFunc component. 
It includes themeOptions (an array of strings) and setSelectedTheme (a function that takes a string argument and returns void).

In the ThemeFunc component, we use this interface to specify the types of the props received, 
ensuring that TypeScript recognizes setSelectedTheme as a function that can be called with a string argument.

# Styled Components
